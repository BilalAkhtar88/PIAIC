/* This is Question 7 of Assignment 1 of Quarter 1 of PIAIC Course repeated, to understand the concept of comments.
In Question 7, we had to print number 8 using Addition, Subtraction, Mulitplication and Division Operations.
For my understanding I tried several ways of printing the number while concatenating with string.*/
console.log("Addition: 4 + 4 = " + (4 + 4));
console.log("Subtraction: 9 - 1 = ", 9 - 1);
console.log("Multiplication: 2 * 4 = " + 2 * 4);
console.log("Division: 16 / 2 = ", 16 / 2);
//For understanding, try following:
//console.log("Addition: 4 + 4 = " + 4 + 4);
//console.log("Addition: 4 + 4 = " , 4 + 4);
//console.log("Division: 16 / 2 = " + 16 / 2);
